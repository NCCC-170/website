Highlights and Activities and Accomplishments since Last Approval
Meetings:

Since September, 1997, the NCR-170 committee has met three times. NCR-170 met jointly with USSES (University Statisticians of Southern Experiment Stations) in Oklahoma City in 1998. We primarily revisited and revised the various mixed model workshop materials that were to be presented at the various societies. The only outside invited speaker was Dr. Bob Rodriguez from the SAS Institute to discuss the direction of SAS software at that time. NCR-170 then met in Urbana, IL, in 1999 to start establishing a new direction toward the applications of spatial statistics/geostatistics in agriculture. Dr. Pierre Goovaerts from the University of Michigan and Dr. Konstantin Krivoruchko from ESRI discussed trends in methods and software for geostatistics. NCR-170 met in East Lansing, MI in 2000. John Castelloe was invited from SAS and gave a talk titled, “SAS Tools for Spatial Statistical Inference”. Topics of discussion centered around issues associated spatial correlated data and our continuing interest in mixed model methodologies. The committee will meet jointly with USSES in Arkansas in 2001 and in Maryland in 2002.

Activities Update:

Over the past three years, the NCR-170 committee has focused particularly on exploiting the utility of mixed models and proper use of mixed model software to agricultural and natural resource research scientists and fellow statisticians at various professional society meetings throughout the country. A total of six mixed model workshops was organized by NCR-170 over that time frame. They are listed chronologically and briefly described below. Workshop materials are attached with this report.

Society Meeting:  Ecological Society of America, Baltimore, MD
Date:  August 1, 1998
Workshop Instructor:  Susan Durham
Title:  General Linear Mixed Models in Ecological Studies
Number of Registrants:  28

Society Meeting:  Joint Statistical Meetings (5 societies including American Statistical Association), Dallas, TX
Date:  August 8, 1998
Workshop Instructors:  George Milliken and Linda Young
Title:  Mixed Models for the Practicing Statistician Using SAS
Number of Registrants: 46
Special Notes:  Refer to http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/1998/CEclass.html  for description

Society Meeting:  American Society of Agronomy, Baltimore, MD
Date:  October 18, 1998
Organizer:  Don Bullock
Workshop Instructors:  Susanne Aref, Ted Bailey and Larry Douglass
Title:  Mixed Models: Using PROC MIXED for Biological and Environmental Studies
Number of Registrants:  75
Special Notes:  This workshop was overbooked (only 50 registrants were anticipated). The Precision Agriculture Work Group (PAWG) of the American Society of Agronomy has requested another mixed model workshop from NCR-170 for either 2000 or 2001.

Society Meeting:  Eastern Branch of the Entomological Society of America, Virginia Beach, VA
Date:  Feburary 22, 1999
Title:  Mixed Models Data Analysis, Using PROC MIXED for Biological Research
Instructor:  Larry Douglass
Number of Registrants:  20
Special Notes: Refer to Page 6 of http://www.ento.vt.edu/~shelor/ebesa/Prog993.pdf

Society Meeting:  American Association of Animal Science, Indianapolis, IN
Date:  July 23, 1999
Workshop Instructors:  Robert Tempelman and Larry Douglass
Title:  NCR-170 ASAS Mixed Model Workshop
Number of Registrants:  40
Special Notes:  Refer to Page 92 on http://www.asas.org/99meet/99aspro.pdf  (please note that the NCR project was incorrectly written as NCR 47 on that program). The maximum number of registrants was set to 40. The 2000 Joint Meetings of American Association of Animal Science – American Dairy Science Association will rerun this workshop with up to 100 registrants.

Society Meeting:  Joint Statistical Meetings, Baltimore, MD
Date:  August 8, 1999
Workshop Instructors:  George Milliken and Linda Young
Title:  Mixed Models for the Practicing Statistician Using the SAS System
Number of Registrants:  35
Special Notes:  Refer to: http://www.amstat.org/meetings/jsm/1999/jsm99prog/session_info.asp?sid=357  for description. This course was videotaped for the benefit of future professional development offerings.

Society Meeting:  Joint Meeting of American Association of Animal Science and the American Dairy Science Association, Baltimore, MD
Date:  July 27-28, 2000
Workshop Instructors:  Robert Tempelman and Larry Douglass
Title:  NCR-170 ASAS-ADSA Mixed Model Workshop
Number of Registrants:  92
Special Notes:  Refer to: http://www.baltimore2k.org/thru.pdf   The 2001 Joint Meetings of American Association of Animal Science – American Dairy Science-American Poultry Science has indicated an interest in a continuation in statistics workshops.

Other related mixed model outreach activities since September, 1997:

1.  Video teleconferencing for and visits to outlying experimental stations (George Milliken, Walt Stroup, Linda Young) and other campuses (Larry Douglass)

2.  Industry (e.g. animal pharmaceutical companies) workshops (George Milliken, Walt Stroup, Rob Tempelman)

3.  Invited Paper (“Using Mixed Models: an Easier and Safer Linear Models Procedure” presented by Larry Douglass at 1998 American Association of Animal Science Meetings)

Specific goals for the next two years:

NCR-170 has two primary foci for the duration of the project.

1.  Continue to develop and offer mixed model workshops. The current familiarity of particularly senior agricultural research scientists with mixed models is generally poor and will only be corrected with a sustained education and outreach effort. This is particularly important as graduate students are being instructed with mixed model methods, yet face challenges from graduate guidance committees and manuscript reviewers.

2.  Explore spatial statistics as the next area of emphasis for the committee. Current efforts are aimed toward helping committee members understand classical issues (e.g. variography and its uses for describing and estimating biological processes) and the consideration of spatial concepts in designed experiments and geographic information systems. Our next meeting (2000) will focus on a critical evaluation of software that could be recommended for agricultural research scientists. This meeting will also provide a professional development opportunity for committee participants to sharpen their consulting toolbase in spatial statistics.
