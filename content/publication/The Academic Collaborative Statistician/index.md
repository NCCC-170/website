title: 'The academic collaborative statistician: Research, training and evaluation'
abstract: Statisticians with a primary collaborative position at their academic institution
  have a unique role in combining domain science and statistical research and training
  and mentoring graduate students. As a result, it is important that their responsibilities
  be clearly understood by both the collaborative statisticians and their departments.
  In this paper, we discuss various steps that these statisticians can take to be
  successful and to be appropriately evaluated for their work. These steps are even
  more important now because a combination of new technologies, quantitative experts
  in other fields and the growth of data science in general seems to have put the
  field of Statistics at a crossroads. For the discipline to continue to flourish,
  we argue that it is critical that the role of the collaborative statistician be
  maintained and valued in statistics departments.
