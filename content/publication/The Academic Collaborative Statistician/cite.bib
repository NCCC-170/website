abstract = {Statisticians with a primary collaborative position at their academic institution have a unique role in combining domain science and statistical research and training and mentoring graduate students. As a result, it is important that their responsibilities be clearly understood by both the collaborative statisticians and their departments. In this paper, we discuss various steps that these statisticians can take to be successful and to be appropriately evaluated for their work. These steps are even more important now because a combination of new technologies, quantitative experts in other fields and the growth of data science in general seems to have put the field of Statistics at a crossroads. For the discipline to continue to flourish, we argue that it is critical that the role of the collaborative statistician be maintained and valued in statistics departments.},
