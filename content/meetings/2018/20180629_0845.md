For the past few years, the Department of Statistics at the University of Wisconsin- Madison has been engaged in a revision of the curriculum for introductory statistics courses targeted to non-statistics majors. We will briefly discuss some of the issues faced, solutions attempted, and lessons learned during the process, touching specifically on our chosen learning objectives, assessment, and course structures, as well as the assignment, management, and evaluation of instructors and teaching assistants. We hope that this generates a discussion among the group about how introductory statistics courses are taught at other universities, and about best teaching practices for such courses.
