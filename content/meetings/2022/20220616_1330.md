After many years of statisticians working to help collaborators interpret p-values correctly, it feels like notable progress has been made since the 2016 ASA statement, with well publicized editorials in a wide variety of journals as well as publications for the general public.* What progress have you seen, in both your collaborators and in the journals you publish in?* Where do you still see progress that needs to be made?* What specific actions have you seen be successful in working with collaborators and journals?How has this changed (or not) in recent years?* Are there specific methodologies that supplement or replace p-values that you use, and in which fields and/or journals have you used them?
