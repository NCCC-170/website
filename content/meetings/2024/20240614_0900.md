This group discussion will target conceptual and methodological best practices that users of generalized linear mixed models (GLMM) should know and address appropriately, regardless of choice of software platform. Using an example driven approach, we further describe software implementation of GLMMs in SAS and R. We present differential capabilities of these software platforms to address specific GLMM issues (to the best of our abilities). Last, we invite contributions from R-literate readers.
