Statistical consulting plays a critical role in advancing research and decision-making, so it is important to provide quality training to students and statisticians in this area to ensure competence, credibility, and ethical standard. In my presentation, I provide a detailed overview of the structured consulting courses provided by the Department of Statistics at University of Nebraska – Lincoln, along with the consulting activities available to master’s and PhD students. Following the presentation, the session will invite open discussions regarding consulting education in academia, emphasizing challenges and collaborative strategies to enhance students’ development into proficient statistical consultants.
