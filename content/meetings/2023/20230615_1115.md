We will lead a panel discussion on the challenges and advantages of teaching online. Topics may include course formats (fully or partially online, synchronous or asynchronous), pros and cons of the technologies available, effectively communicating with students, managing the course, adjusting assessments (e.g., exams, homework, quizzes, discussion posts, projects, etc.), and maintaining academic integrity.
