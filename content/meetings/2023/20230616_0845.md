An open discussion on research reproducibility. The National Academy of Sciences defines research reproducibility as “obtaining consistent results using the same data and code as the original study.” The American Society for Cell Biology defines this further: ‘analytical replication’ is obtaining the same results of the original data through reanalysis; ‘direct replication’ is reproducing results by using same experimental design and conditions; and ‘systemic replication’ is reproducing findings using different experimental conditions (e.g. a different organism). Are these definitions sufficient? How do you see these things manifested in your work or that of others? And what can or should we do about failings in research reproducibility?
