In this talk, I'll discuss how I used statistics to assist two scientists studying Soil Science and Geography, respectively. For the client in Soil Science, I will explain how we selected a suitable class of models for studying drivers of soil thickness in the continental United States. For the client in Geography, I will explain how we are working to determine how water depth and permafrost depth have changed over time using repeated measurements of arctic pond sites.
